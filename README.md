# Efficient Crawler for Scalable Web Data Acquisition

This repository provides additional content, code, data, and models supplementing the
research article *Efficient Crawler for Scalable Web Data Acquisition* by Antoine Gauquier,
[Ioana Manolescu](https://pages.saclay.inria.fr/ioana.manolescu/), and [Pierre Senellart](https://pierre.senellart.com/).

## Additional content

[Supplementary material for the original paper](supplementary.pdf), with
detailed experimental results, additional related work, and proof of
intractability of the graph crawling problem.

## Dataset

We are currently working on making locally replicated crawling data available (direct availability
being impossible due to rights issues).

## Code
