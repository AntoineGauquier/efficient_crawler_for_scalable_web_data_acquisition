The On-Line to Local Crawler aims at locally replicating websites, to conduct local crawling experiments.

To do such a replication, please execute the script [online_to_local_crawling.sh](code/online_to_local_crawler/online_to_local_crawling.sh) and fill all the requested elements. The local replica will then be saved in the [data](code/local_crawlers/data/) folder.

*As we respect crawling ethic rules, the local replication of some websites might be really long.*
